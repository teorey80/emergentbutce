# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

While basic CSV import works (100% success for simple cases), Turkish bank credit card statements with reward patterns (MAXIMIL/MAXIPUAN) are being incorrectly filtered. Root cause: Amount parsing logic error in server.py line 676 - when description contains MAXIMIL/MAXIPUAN, the code tries to parse amounts like '1.544,14' or '1,544.14' with simple string replacement, causing parsing errors that trigger filtering. This affects real-world İş Bankası credit card imports. CRITICAL: 2/3 major Turkish bank format cases failing. Title cleaning works perfectly (100% success), point filtering works correctly, but legitimate transactions with reward patterns are lost."

WORKING CORRECTLY: (1) Title/Description cleaning - 100% success removing MAXIMIL/MAXIPUAN/WORLDPUAN patterns, installment info, location codes. (2) Point value filtering - correctly filters amounts <10 TL when description contains reward patterns. (3) Turkish number format parsing - works for simple cases. CRITICAL FAILURE: When legitimate transactions have reward patterns in description (e.g., 'METRO UMRANIYE TEKEL ISTANBUL TR KAZANILAN MAXIMIL:3,09 MAXIPUAN:0,46' with amount '1.544,14'), the amount parsing logic fails due to improper string conversion in line 676. This causes legitimate ₺1544.14 transactions to be filtered as points. IMPACT: Real Turkish bank credit card statement imports lose actual transaction data. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX."
